				<p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding agreement between you ("Clients") and CitrusZyn (“CitrusZyn,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) governing use of our website, software, and services (collectively, the “Services” or “Products”)				</p>

				<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Clients are granted a limited right to access and use of the software for the duration specified by the credited time in their account, subject to these terms and conditions.</li>
					<li>Clients may elect to enroll in automated payments and are responsible for all recurring charges until such time as they choose to cancel their subscription. By enrolling in automated payments, clients agree to automatic debiting of their payment method on file for any such recurring charges. Clients acknowledge that it is their responsibility to ensure that the payment information on file is accurate and up-to-date. Any failure to pay any such recurring charges may result in the immediate termination of the client’s account without notice.</li>
                    <li>Clients are entitled to suspend their subscription through the available freezing process, which temporarily halts the consumption of credited time and deactivates the clients’ account. It is important to note that clients will not have access to their accounts during the freeze period, and they may only freeze their account once every seven days. FloydFN reserves the right to modify the freezing process without prior notice. It is the responsibility of the client to monitor their account and ensure that the freeze period has been properly activated. FloydFN is not liable for any loss or damage incurred due to the Client’s failure to freeze their account.</li>
                    <li>Clients agree that they are responsible for any and all charges incurred in connection with their account, including but not limited to all applicable taxes, fees, and charges.</li>
                    <li>Clients understand that they are acquiring digital assets with no right of withdrawal, cancellation or return, and that they will not receive accommodation for used products. FloydFN reserves the right to refuse, cancel, or suspend transactions and/or purchases for any reason, including but not limited to suspected fraudulent or abusive behavior. FloydFN may also modify or discontinue its digital assets at any time without liability to Clients.</li>   
                    <li>Any attempts by Clients to sell or transfer ownership of their FloydFN account is strictly prohibited and violates the terms and conditions outlined in this legal agreement.</li>
					<li>Clients understand that they are acquiring digital assets with no right of withdrawal, cancellation or return, and that they will not receive accommodation for used products. FloydFN reserves the right to refuse, cancel, or suspend transactions and/or purchases for any reason, including but not limited to suspected fraudulent or abusive behavior.

					<li>Clients acknowledge the term “Lifetime” pertains solely to the duration of their account’s existence and can be terminated by FloydFN at its discretion for any reason. The use of the term “lifetime” does not create any obligations for FloydFN to maintain the Client’s account for any specific duration. The termination of the Client’s account shall be determined solely by FloydFN’s judgment and is not subject to challenge. </li>
					
				</ol>
                <h3>Refund Policy</h3>

Clients must contact the FloydFN team to request a refund and provide relevant documentation and evidence to support their request. </li>
